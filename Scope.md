This project provides a low-cost, real-time earthquake detection and alert system using an Arduino Uno and ADXL335 accelerometer. It is ideal for educational purposes, basic safety applications, and prototype development in earthquake-prone regions. The system can be expanded to include wireless alerts, data logging, and integration with IoT platforms or emergency response systems for broader impact.
