**Alert system for Earthquakes**
**AIM:**
The aim of this project is to design and implement an Arduino-based earthquake detector using an ADXL335 accelerometer, LCD display, buzzer, and LED. The system detects unusual ground vibrations and provides real-time alerts through visual and audio signals, enhancing early warning and safety measures during seismic activity.
**Results:**
• When vibration is detected, the LED and buzzer turn ON, and the LCD displays "Earthquake ALERT"
• When no vibration is detected, the LED and buzzer remain OFF, and the LCD shows real-time X, Y, Z axis values
• The system mimics a real-time earthquake detection and alert system, and it performed as expected during Tinkercad simulation
